            "question_1": "Why is Andean Chocho considered a complete protein?",
            "answer_1": "It contains all nine essential amino acids—rare in plant foods—making it a true complete protein.",
            "question_2": "How much protein does Andean Chocho have compared to other sources?",
            "answer_2": "Chocho offers about 54% protein by weight, higher than most plant protein.",
            "question_3": "Is Andean Chocho good for people with food sensitivities?",
            "answer_3": "Yes. It’s naturally gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, keto and vegan friendly and low in allergens.",
            "question_4": "Does Andean Chocho contain anti-nutrients like soy or beans?",
            "answer_4": "No. Unlike soy, Andean chocho is very low in phytates and lectins, so nutrients are more bioavailable.",
            "question_5": "Why is Andean Chocho called a superfood?",
            "answer_5": "Because it’s one of the few plants with all nine essential amino acids, high protein (over 50%), plus fiber, calcium, iron, zinc, copper manganese and antioxidants.",
            "question_6": "Is Andean Chocho good for vegans and vegetarians?",
            "answer_6": "Yes! It’s one of the cleanest and most complete vegan protein sources.",
            "question_7": "Does Andean Chocho help with weight management?",

            "question_8": "Is Andean Chocho sustainable?",
            "answer_8": "Chocho thrives in poor soils at high altitudes without pesticides or irrigation, making it eco-friendly and climate resilient.",
            "question_9": "Does Andean Chocho cause bloating like beans or peas?",
            "answer_9": "No. Unlike many legumes, chocho is low in compounds that typically cause digestive discomfort.",
            "question_10": "Why is Andean chocho better for the planet?",
            "answer_10": "It enriches the soil, grows without pesticides, and requires minimal water.",
            "question_11": "Why is it called PRONTO CHOCHO?",
            "answer_11": "Chocho is the traditional Andean name for a mighty little bean (Lupinus mutabilis) that’s been fueling communities in the highlands for centuries. It’s rich in protein, fiber, and history — a true superfood rooted in Pachamama (Mother Earth).\n\nNow here’s the fun part: in other Spanish-speaking countries, the word chocho can mean totally different things — sometimes a sweet nickname for a grandparent, sometimes just playful slang. We love that it makes people smile, but to us, chocho will always mean the Andean superbean.\n\nAnd what about Pronto? Traditionally, preparing chocho takes hours of soaking, rinsing, and cooking. We’ve done all that work for you, so you can enjoy it pronto — fast, easy, and ready to fuel your day.\nSo, Pronto Chocho = Andean superfood, made simple. Heritage + humor + health, all in one name.",
            "question_12": "What makes PRONTO CHOCHO unique?",
            "answer_12": "PRONTO CHOCHO isn’t just another protein powder—it’s a one-of-a-kind super protein. Here’s why:\n    •    Single-Ingredient Purity – Made from 100% Andean Chocho, with no fillers, sweeteners, or artificial additives.\n    •    Whole-Food Nutrition – Unlike isolates, PRONTO CHOCHO keeps its natural fiber, minerals, and antioxidants intact.\n    •    Naturally Complete Protein – Contains all 9 essential amino acids in balanced proportions, rare for a plant source.\n    •    Hypoallergenic – Free from soy, dairy, gluten, and nuts—safe for almost everyone.\n    •    Gut-Friendly – Gentle on digestion and less likely to cause bloating compared to whey, pea, or soy protein.\n    •    Sustainably Sourced – Grown in the Andes using traditional, eco-friendly farming that supports local communities.\n    •    Neutral, Versatile Flavor – Smooth and slightly nutty taste that works in sweet or savory recipes.",
